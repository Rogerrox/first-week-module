# first-week-module

This is a project that included starter code that needed to be refactored to meet standards without changing the astetics of the webpage. 

My main goal of this project was to change to DIV coding to reflect current up to date standards without changing the webpage appearance and functionality, and even fix any issues concerning appearance and functionality.

Several lines were coded "DIV", which is not in accordance to up to date coding standards. So I change the coding to reflect current standards of code.

I changed line 11 and 26 to Header on the HTML sheet and also changed all the ".header" to "header" in style.css page.
Changing the style.css header on line 11,18,23,27.35 and 39 keeped the header in place as the original web page.

I changed line 13 to line 25 to "nav" to reflect the 3 topics that were to be navigated to other parts of the web site. I noticed that the Search Engine Optimization Selector was coded as a "class" attribute instead of a "ID" attribute which caused no action when the input box was selected. This was changed and the navigation worked for this header as well as the other two input boxes.

Line 27 was changed to "section" and 28 to 50 was changed to "main" to reflect the main part of the web page.
Between tages from 29 to 49 all "div" were changed to "section" to reflect the different containers of information that were displayed on the web page.

I also selected a second "main" section on 51 and 73 to reflect the container to the right of the 1st main part. 
Between the main section were several "div" that were changed to "section" for Lead Generation, Brand Awarness, and Cost Management.

74 and 79 were coded "section" for the footer.
